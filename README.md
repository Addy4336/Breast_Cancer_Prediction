Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features, and the project employs machine learning models to achieve high classification accuracy, with a particular emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives in a medical context. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

Features
Dataset: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (569 samples, 30 features, no missing values)
Preprocessing: Feature selection based on correlation, standardization of features
Models Trained:
